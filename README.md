# DCImagePickerController

`DCImagePickerController` is a drop-in replacement for `UIImagePickerController` that supports selecting multuple items. It is styled after the `UIImagePickerController` found in iOS 7 and above, but it works back to iOS 5.

## Example Usage

`DCImagePickerController` works exactly like `UIImagePickerController`, except without any camera functionality and with two new properties, `minimumNumberOfItems` and `maximumNumberOfItems`.

It requires access to all of the user's photos.
